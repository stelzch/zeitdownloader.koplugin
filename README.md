# Zeit Download

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of 2025, zeit.de switched their login system and now require a CAPTCHA. This plugin therefore does no longer work.

This is a port of my [ZeitDownloader](https://github.com/stelzch/zeitdownloader) script to Lua and packaged as KOReader plugin.

Currently it only supports downloading the most recent version.
